**Memory Card** is a fun *web tool* to help you memorize all kind of stuff, from definitions of words to technical terms. :muscle::brain:

This is written in `React.js` (actually the first web app I have ever made, while learning the mose basiscs concepts from the *docs*).

You can delete the last card added or a certain index of a card or of couse you can delete them all if you are sick of them .<br/>

### :four: Delete - all or some or maybe don't :)

You have 3 options:

  1. Delete them all
  2. Delete last
  3. Delete certain index
